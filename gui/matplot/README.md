# Matplotlib

## Usage Patterns

Two common approaches to plot with Matplotlib.

- The pyplot API  
It is a collection of `The object-oriented API` which is mainly intended for `interactive` plots and `simple` cases of programmatic plot generation. Each `pyplot` function makes some change to a figure:e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure

- The object-oriented API  
At its core, Matplotlib is object-oriented. We recommend directly working with the objects, if you need more control and customization of your plots.

Matplotlib doesn't work with pixels directly, but rather physical sizes(inches) and DPI.
