***Note:*** Mac users may get the following message: This program needs access to the screen. Please run with a Framework build of python, and only when you are logged in on the main display of your Mac. If you see this message and you are not running in a virtualenv, then you need to run your application with pythonw instead of python. If you are running wxPython from within a virtualenv, then see the wxPython wiki for the solution.
